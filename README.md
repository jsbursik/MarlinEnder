#Marlin 2.0.x for Ender 3

This is my Marlin firmware for my Ender 3 with a BLtouch added using [this mount.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3584158)

The board I'm using is the BIGTREETECH SKR Mini E3 V1.2 using the BLtouch as the Z endstop.

Some of these settings WILL NOT work for you. Specifically the Z offset and the VREF's set in Configuration_adv.h for the TMC2209's.
